This repository aims to clean a dataset to produce high quality dataset which can become a backbone for a good machine learning model.
It will shwocase the steps and process involved in cleaning a highly messed up dataset.
The dataset is messy with plenty of errors to be corrected: missing values, empty rows and columns, bad variable names, multiple or wrong date formats, numeric columns containing symbols, units, characters, thousand separators, multiple and wrong decimal separators, typographic mistakes and a multiple categorical variable miscoded as a unique character variable
